# Gas Station Data Files Naming Convention

This document describes the naming convention used for gas station data files generated by the orchestrator.

## Overview

The system now uses intelligent filename generation based on the scope of networks requested for parsing. This provides clear identification of what data is contained in each file.

## Naming Patterns

### 1. All Networks File
**Pattern:** `all_gas_stations_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.xlsx`

**When used:** Only when ALL 6 available networks are requested for parsing:
- Lukoil (lukoil)
- Bashneft (bashneft) 
- Gazprom (gazprom)
- Yandex Maps (yandex_maps)
- Tatneft (tatneft)
- Neftmagistral (neftmagistral)

**Example:** `all_gas_stations_20250107_143055.xlsx`

### 2. Specific Networks with Names
**Pattern:** `gas_stations_network1_network2_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.xlsx`

**When used:** When 3 or fewer specific networks are requested

**Examples:**
- `gas_stations_lukoil_20250107_143055.xlsx` (single network)
- `gas_stations_gazprom_lukoil_20250107_143055.xlsx` (two networks)
- `gas_stations_bashneft_gazprom_lukoil_20250107_143055.xlsx` (three networks)

### 3. Multiple Networks (Generic)
**Pattern:** `gas_stations_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.xlsx`

**When used:** When 4 or 5 specific networks are requested (too many to include all names in filename)

**Example:** `gas_stations_20250107_143055.xlsx`

## Timestamp Format

All files use the same timestamp format:
- **YYYYMMDD:** Date (e.g., 20250107 for January 7, 2025)
- **HHMMSS:** Time in 24-hour format (e.g., 143055 for 14:30:55)

## Backward Compatibility

The data loading functions support both the new naming convention and legacy files:
- Legacy files starting with `all_gas_stations_` continue to work
- New files with any of the patterns above are recognized
- Timestamp extraction handles both old and new filename formats

## Benefits

✅ **Clear Scope Identification:** Filename immediately indicates whether you have all networks or a subset

✅ **Network Visibility:** For small subsets, specific network names are visible in the filename

✅ **No Confusion:** `all_gas_stations_` prefix is reserved only for truly complete datasets

✅ **Organized File Management:** Easy to identify and manage different types of data exports

## Implementation Notes

- Network names in filenames are sorted alphabetically for consistency
- The system automatically detects which networks were successfully parsed
- Files are only labeled as "all_gas_stations" if ALL configured networks were included
- Loading functions prioritize newer files based on timestamp extraction
